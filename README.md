# Problem Statement

In Simplest terms ,Genetic algorithms are an optimization technique used to solve nonlinear or non differentiable optimization problems.
The purpose of this project is to implement the methodology of genetic algorithms to obtain the result for an NP problem.For Our Implementation we have choosen a very famous problem,Travelling Salesman.Given a set of cities and distance between every pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point.
